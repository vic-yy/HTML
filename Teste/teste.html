    <h1>My first Website!</h1>

    <p>
        <!-- <strong> to highlight the text, <em> is for italic, < -->
        <!-- -->
            Lets make our text <strong> bold </strong>. Now let's make it <em> italic </em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can also mix our formatation and make it <strong> <em> bold and italic</em></strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other way to make it bold and italic is using <b>b </b> and <i> i </i>. But they don't make it acessible to everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can make a link to somewhere using anchor and href like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Videos for free.</a>
        <!-- Don't forget to add http:// before the link so it directs you to a absolute path to the website-->
        And we can also create a link to another thing in the same folder of this http like this empty <a href = "Template.html"> Template.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now let's learn how to add images like this one <img src="https://img.poki.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=78,width=600,height=600,fit=cover,f=auto/89025597b6c25bc9a444459fa0b3eb9a.jpg" alt="experiment_1">
        and this one <img src="img/teste.jfif" alt="experiment_2">
        The alt we use after the picture name is the description of the image
                         
        <!-- But we can also add images by a relative path like this: <img src="teste.jfif"> -->
    </p>
    <p> 
        Let's talk about the names we use for the html because we need to avoid somethings like spaces, number, capitals and anything that is not simple text.
